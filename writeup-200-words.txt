This project implements a Social Media Content Analyzer that accepts PDF and image uploads,
extracts text, and produces focused engagement improvements.I used pdfjs (pdfjs-dist) 
for PDF parsing to better preserve formatting, and Tesseract.js for OCR on scanned images.
After extraction, the backend runs lightweight heuristics — hashtag extraction, a simple 
readability estimate, and CTA detection — to gather metadata.The system then constructs a
concise prompt targeted at social-media optimization and sends it to a generative model 
(Gemini) when available; if the model is not configured, the server returns a deterministic
fallback of practical suggestions.On the frontend, I improved UX by adding drag-and-drop 
highlights, file size/type validation (10MB), progress feedback, and clear error messages.
The project includes basic persistence to MongoDB for uploaded file metadata, and the README 
now contains local setup and deployment guidance.These changes align the app closely 
with the assignment brief by preserving PDF formatting, supporting OCR, providing engagement-focused 
output, and delivering improved error handling and loading states.
